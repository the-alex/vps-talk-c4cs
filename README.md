# Virtual Private Servers Talk

## TODO
* How do you set up a VPS hosted website with domain name?
    * Something about DNS.
* Relearn how to use the neural style program
* Decide interactive vs. slides (or how much to use of both)

## Goals
By the end of this talk, students should understand how to set up and use a virtual private server.

* Know what a VPS is.
* Know what they can do.
* Have one or two clearly understood use cases.
    * File Storage (Movies / HD Music)
    * Hosting a personal web site or project.
    * Docker? Vagrant? CI (you would just use Travis, though, right)?

## Lesson Plan
This is how we're going ot achieve the above goals.

1. What is a virtual private server?
    * "A VPS runs its own copy of an operating system, and customers have superuser-level access to that operating system instance, so they can install almost any software that runs on that OS. For many purposes they are functionally equivalent to a dedicated physical server, and being software-defined, are able to be much more easily created and configured." -- Wikipedia
    * It's a computer in the great cloud above.
    * The Internet is simply a network of computers, all able to share files with each other. This brings to mind a few simple use cases.
1. What can I do with a VPS?
    * Host a personal website or app
    * Run a program for a long time without interruption (web crawler)
    * Rent a more powerful PC (neural style)
